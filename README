To install the solvers and auxiliary files, follow the steps outlined in
the following README files:

1) System preparation (README.PREP)
2) OpenFOAM installation (README.OF)
3) User setup (README.USER)
4) Libraries (README.LIB)
5) Solvers (README.SOL)

These instructions will create a global installation of OpenFOAM
(as root) and the local directory $HOME/OpenFOAM/$USER-$OFVER
The local directory contains applications (with subdirectories
libraries and solvers) and the run directory where cases are executed

Note:
1) We use yum-based linux systems and the installation is known to work
on CentOS (v5/v6) and Scientific Linux (v7).
2) However, this is the first version of this document and not all the
steps have been verified at this point. Please let me know if you have
problems
