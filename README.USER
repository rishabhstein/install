To set up the user directory in the standard OpenFOAM way:

Edit your .bashrc to include the following:

# Set aliases for OpenFOAM environments
OFVER=4.x
FOAM=/global/usr/apps/OF4
export FOAM_INST_DIR=$FOAM
source $FOAM_INST_DIR/OpenFOAM-$OFVER/etc/bashrc


mkdir -p $HOME/OpenFOAM/$USER-$OFVER
mkdir -p $HOME/.OpenFOAM-$OFVER


mv the install directory to $HOME/OpenFOAM
cp controlDict from the OpenFOAM-version/etc to $HOME/.OpenFOAM-$OFVER
cp prefs.sh from this directory to $HOME/.OpenFOAM-$OFVER


Notes:
1) FOAM points to the OpenFOAM installation directory
2) OFVER is the OpenFOAM version
3) The gcc version in prefs.sh must match the one used to compile
OpenFOAM
