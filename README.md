The solvers porousFoam and fractureFoam utilize some of the libraries
from Vitaliy's 3D code. The install scripts and instructions in this
repo should help things go more smoothly. 

First make your local OpenFOAM directory and clone the install files:

mkdir $HOME/OpenFOAM
cd $HOME/OpenFOAM
clone //https://github.com/tonyladd/install
