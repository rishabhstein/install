To set up the solvers directory:

cd $HOME/OpenFOAM/$USER-$OFVER/applications/solvers
mkdir solvers
cp -rp $HOME/OpenFOAM/install/Allw* solvers


cd solvers
git clone https://github.com/tonyladd/porousFoam
git clone https://github.com/tonyladd/fractureFoam
Allwmake


run
git clone https://github.com/tonyladd/porousCases
git clone https://github.com/tonyladd/fractureCases


Notes:
1) Once the solvers are compiled you can run the test cases in the run
directory. "run" is an OF alias to change to the run directory
2) You only need install the solvers and test cases that you need
3) A similar procedure can be used to install Vitaliy's 3D code and
related utilities, which use the same libraries:

git clone https://github.com/vitst/dissolFoam
